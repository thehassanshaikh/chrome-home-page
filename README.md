So, after getting bored of Chrome's home page style, I redesignÂ it for my own use.

You are free to tweak it and use it as you see fit.

## Set Up

1. Open the Chrome menu (select the icon with three dots to the top-left of the screen) and select Settings. 
1. Select On startup on the sidebar.
1. Under the On startup section, Open a specific page or set of pages option
1.After selecting the option, select Add a new page repeatedly and enter this ( https://thehassanshaikh.github.io/chrome-home-page/ ) address to open the browser to open.
